<title>Introduction</title></head><body><div class="section"><h1>Introduction</h1><p>This document describes an approach to event driven programming in Forth, in
the literate programming style.
Unlike a typical literate program written in full prose, this document is
was written to be used as a slide deck for a deep drive code tour.
While the presentation attempts to be comprehensive,
some supplemental information is included in a non-slide chapter
at the end of this document.
